TODO: find out the correct way of doumenting this mapping.

1. test_record table:

The following is the column name mapping to API attribute names in the res.json.payload object:

TODO: redocument this as a table format:

```
    t.id as "testRecordId",
    t.user_id as "testUserId",
    t.test_some_string as "testRecordSomeString",
    t.test_some_int as "testRecordSomeInt",
    t.test_some_status as "testSomeStatus",
    to_char(t.test_date_posted, 'dd-mm-yyyy') as "testRecordDatePosted",
    t.create_date_time as "testRecordCreateDateTime"
```

plus, when POSTING (inserting) a new record, only need to send in the following (the others are created by the database)

-   testUserId
-   testRecordSomeString
-   testRecordSomeInt
-   testSomeStatus

2. user table

3. event table
